###Linking, Named Routes & Parameters (Intro to Rails)


This basic Video Sharing App has been developed following the **second lesson** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3).

#####Purpose:

Start using **Rails helpers** to write cleaner and more efficient code for linking to pages, and begin to use views as templates. 

#####Topics:
- Using the `link_to` Rails helper instead of `<a href=""></a>` anchor tags.
- Linking to **named routes**.
- Passing data from the client to the Rails app through **parameters**.
- Using **query strings** and **dynamic segments**.
- Displaying **dynamic view pages** based on parameters.

#####Goal:
- Learn about linking to different pages and collecting data from a user through parameters.
