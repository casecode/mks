#Metube 0.5
###CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)


This basic Video Sharing App has been developed following the **fifth lesson** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3/tree/e-start).

#####Purpose:

Finishing the CRUD actions and complete a fully functional application that allows us to create, watch, edit and delete videos. 

#####Topics:
- Creating the neccesary **methods** and **routes** to have a full fledged **CRUD** app: **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Destroy**.
- Using **forms** within a Rails application to gather input from a user.
- Using **partials** to write cleaner code and easier to maintain.
- Using **strong_parameters**.
- Using **resources** to write cleaner routes.

#####Goal:
- To build the rest of the methods we will be using for our application: **new**, **create**, **edit**, **update** and **destroy**. 

#####Challenges:

- Change **show_all** to **index**: **routes**, **controllers** and **views**.
