#Metube 0.6
###Associations


This basic Video Sharing App has been developed following the **sixth lesson** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3/tree/g-start).

#####Purpose:

Learn how to **associate** models using `has_many` and `belongs_to` and add validations to model attributes.

#####Topics:
- Associations: `has_many`.
- Associations: `belongs_to`.
- Database `where` queries.
- Validations.


#####Goal:
- To create an app that allows a user to create posts that belongs to him, creating associations that allows models to interact with each other.

#####Challenge:
- Look up `has_secure_password` and implement true password-based authentication.


#####Extra:
Created a full **Authentication System** using:

- **REGEX** that validates email format.
- **Gem bcrypt** to hash password into a secure format.
