###Test Driven Development


This basic Video Sharing App has been developed following the **eight lesson** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3/tree/add_ratings).

#####Purpose:

Introduction to **Test Driven Development in Rails** using **RSPEC**. 

#####Topics:
- **RSpec**
- Model Validations
	- **Presence**
	- **Uniqueness**
	- **Scope**
	- **Inclusion**
- Model Association: **Has Many Through**.
- Average Rating Method

#####Goal:
- Create all the missing pieces of code using the given tests as the specification for what to build, to make all test pass. 

#####Challenge:

- **Refactor avg_rating:** I used the ternary operator to DRY code.
