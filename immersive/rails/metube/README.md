#Metube App


This basic Video Sharing App has been developed following the **first week of lessons** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3), and the code of each app comes from a different branch.

Metube was created from a very basic static site to a full CRUD app. Each day we would implement new steps to be able not only to build it, but also to learn with full understanding what was going on.

Each app covers a few topics:

- [**Metube 0.1**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/metube/metube-1): Routes, Controllers & Views.
- [**Metube 0.2**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/metube/metube-2): Linking, Named Routes & Parameters.
- [**Metube 0.3**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/metube/metube-3): ActiveRecord & Rails Console.
- [**Metube 0.4**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/metube/metube-4): Migrations & Instance Methods.
- [**Metube 0.5**](https://github.com/makersquare/metube-cohort3/tree/e-start): CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
