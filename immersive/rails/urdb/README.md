#URDB
###Advancing Ruby on Rails


This basic **IMDB** clone has been developed following the **second week of lessons** on [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) at [**MakerSquare**](http://www.makersquare.com/).

Base code taken from **github:** [makersquare/metube-cohort3](https://github.com/makersquare/urdb), and the starting code of each app comes from a different branch.

**URDB was developed from a single model CRUD app to a complex app where many models seamlessly interact with each other, spiced with RSPEC Tests and the Rotten Tomatoes API.** 

Each app covers a few topics:

- [**URDB 0.1**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/urdb/urdb-1): Project created without instructions, to practice the accumulated knowledge. The first assignment of the second week. CRUD practice.
- [**URDB 0.2**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/urdb/urdb-2): Active Record Associations (Part 1).
- [**URDB 0.3**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/urdb/urdb-3): **Haml:** HTML, all grown up.
- [**URDB 0.4**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/urdb/urdb-4): Active Record Associations (Part 2).
- [**URDB 0.5**](https://github.com/drjorgepolanco/mks/tree/master/immersive/rails/urdb/urdb-5): Model Methods with RSPEC Testing & Rotten Tomatoes API.
